## Register your AWS DeepLens device

Before we can start using the AWS DeepLens device, you must register the device to your account. Registering allows the device to communicate with your AWS account and makes it easy for you to manage the device.

Follow [how to register your AWS DeepLens device](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/deeplens/latest/dg/deeplens-getting-started-register.html) from the AWS DeepLens documentation
