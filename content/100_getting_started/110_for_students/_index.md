## Getting Started for students

If you’re here to learn how to build machine learning models and deploy it to AWS DeepLens, you’ve come to the right section.

We will use some machine learning terminology in this section, if you're not familiar with machine learning terminology, refer to the [terminology section](/000_introduction/020_how_deeplens_works/).

#### How to navigate this site

Our tutorials are organized by level of difficulty. If you're completely new to machine learning and AWS, start at the beginner section.

In the beginner section, you will familiarize yourself with the DeepLens camera and its features. You will deploy sample machine learning projects that are pre-built for you and see how they perform. You will not need to know how to code to complete this section.

In the intermediate section, you'll learn to extend the sample projects to build out applications that uses the power of [Amazon Rekognition](https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/), a machine learning service for image and video analysis with powerful cloud-based models built by AWS. You will  need basic coding skills to complete this section.

Finally in the advanced section, you'll learn to build your own custom machine learning models and deploy them to AWS DeepLens. You will  need basic coding skills to complete this section.

To start you will need an AWS account if you don't have one already. We'll help you create one in the next section.
