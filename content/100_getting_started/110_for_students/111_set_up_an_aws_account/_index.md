## Set up an AWS account

Follow these steps if you need to setup an AWS account for yourself. If you are in a workshop or classroom setting, 
ask your instructor about accounts that may have been set up for you.

1. Create a new AWS account by following the [How do I create and activate a new AWS account?](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account/)
   tutorial. 
2. Use the [Create your first IAM Admin user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediapackage/latest/ug/setting-up-create-iam-user.html)
   topic from the *AWS Identity and Access Management User Guide*. 
3. That's it! You're ready to get started.
