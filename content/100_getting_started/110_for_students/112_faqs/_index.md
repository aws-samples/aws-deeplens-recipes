## Student FAQs

**Do I need an AWS DeepLens device to complete the tutorials?**

Yes. You can buy an [AWS DeepLens device on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07JLSHR23).

**How much will it cost to complete the tutorials?**

While we'll try to stay in the [AWS free tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/) as much as possible, the cost to complete each tutorial will vary. Each tutorial will list the AWS cost to complete it upfront.

**Do you offer an educational discount?**

Teachers and students who are members of [AWS Educate](https://aws.amazon.com/education/awseducate/) can get discounted or free AWS DeepLens devices. Please [contact us](mailto:aws-deeplens-team@amazon.com) for more details.
