## Getting Started

To start your journey with AWS DeepLens, you will need an AWS account and a sense of adventure.

This section is first divided into two paths: 

* If you're a student or developer learning about AWS DeepLens your own, [take the student path](/100_getting_started/110_for_students/)
* if you're a teacher looking to use AWS DeepLens as a teaching tool, [take the teacher path](/100_getting_started/120_for_teachers/).
* If you're a teacher who wants to test out DeepLens first, take the student path.
