## Suggested Learning Paths

#### For introduction to STEM

* Start with [deploying sample models](/200_begineer/210_deploy_a_sample_project/) and discuss the impacts of machine learning on computer vision and how we interface with computers

#### For college projects

* For image classifcation projects, start with the [build your own image classifcation model tutorial](/400_advanced/410_build_a_custom_ml/)
* For object detection projects, start with the [bird detection tutorial](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/identifying-bird-species-on-the-edge-using-the-amazon-sagemaker-built-in-object-detection-algorithm-and-aws-deeplens/)

#### For cloud and programming courses

* Use the [Worker Safety](/300_intermediate/310_worker_safety/) or [Coffee Consumption](/300_intermediate/320_track_coffee_consumption/) lab to introduce students to using AWS services such AWS Lambda, Amazon S3 and Amazon Rekognition for building cloud applications

#### For math and data science courses

* Start with [deploying sample models](/200_begineer/210_deploy_a_sample_project/) and discuss how computers "see" the world with the help of linear algebra and how machine learning models learn from data
* Use [build your own image classifcation model](/400_advanced/410_build_a_custom_ml/) as a lab activity to supplement lessons about convolutional neural networks
