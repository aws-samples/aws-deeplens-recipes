## Set up project storage with Amazon S3

Through the tutorials, you will use Amazon S3 to store your data, your project files and any images you send back from the AWS DeepLens camera. You will create a bucket to store your data. No one else has access to this data except you.

Follow [how to setup an Amazon S3 bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/user-guide/create-bucket.html) from the Amazon S3 documentation. 

Make sure your bucket name start with **deeplens-**
