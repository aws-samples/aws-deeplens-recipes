## What is AWS DeepLens?

AWS DeepLens is a fully programmable video camera that help developers expand their machine learning skills through projects, tutorials and sample code.

In particular AWS DeepLens helps developers create projects with deep learning, a machine learning technique that uses neural networks to learn have enabled computers to make accurate predictions based on visual imagery.

#### What can you build with DeepLens?

Out of the box, DeepLens comes with many sample projects that you can use for your application.
